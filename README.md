# dtlvnative

Provides pre-built native dependencies for
[Datalevin](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin) database. This is done by
packaging the compiled static or shared C libraries and header files in JAR
files.

Three types of libraries are built here.

1. Static libraries. These are used in GraalVM native image version of
   Datalevin and are built using the musl tool chain.

2. Shared libraries built on native platforms. These are built using native tool
   chains of the respective platform due to good availability of these platforms
   on free public CI/CD platforms. These are under directory `*-shared`.

3. Cross compiled shared libraries. These are built using zig build tool. These
   are under directory matching zig target names. Right now, only windows shared
   library is built this way.
